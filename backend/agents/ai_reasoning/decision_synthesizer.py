DecisionSynthesizerAgent — Produces the final comprehensive audit report.

This is the most important output in the entire NIV AI system.
After Marcus, Zara, and Soren have debated the user's specific financial
situation across 4 rounds, this agent synthesizes everything into a
6-domain specialist audit that covers every angle a real advisory team
would cover when a family faces the biggest financial decision of their life.

The 6 domains:
    1. Financial Analysis   — affordability, EMI sensitivity, opportunity cost,
                              total interest burden, net worth impact, break-even
    2. Risk Analysis        — all 5 stress scenarios quantified, sector job risk,
                              medical emergency trajectory, rate shock history,
                              emergency fund adequacy, concentration risk
    3. Legal Advisory       — title checklist, RERA status, OC, encumbrance,
                              builder complaint history, agreement clauses
    4. Banking Advisory     — multi-lender comparison, FOIR, prepayment strategy,
                              PMAY eligibility, co-applicant structure
    5. Tax Advisory         — Section 24B, 80C, joint optimization, effective
                              post-tax EMI, capital gains, rental taxation
    6. Behavioral Analysis  — each bias mapped to rupee impact, FOMO overpayment
                              risk, emotional commitment cost, decision quality

Prompt routing:
    USE_OLLAMA=true  → lean prompt that fits within 4096 tokens for local testing
    USE_OLLAMA=false → full 6-domain specialist audit prompt via Gemini 2.0 Flash

The output is designed to be rendered as a 15-25 page PDF report that a
family can take to their CA, bank, or lawyer and use as a working document.
